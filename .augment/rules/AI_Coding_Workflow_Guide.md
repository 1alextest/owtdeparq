AI Coding Agent: Development Protocol
Define Scope & Objectives
Clearly state the problem, goals, and success criteria before coding begins.

Break Down into Numbered Tasks
Decompose the goal into a sequential list of actionable, clearly defined tasks.

Implement Sequentially
Complete one task at a time in order. Do not skip ahead.

Test Each Task
Write both unit and integration tests for every completed task.

Fix Detected Issues
Resolve all test failures and bugs before advancing to the next task.

Repeat Until Done
Iterate the implement → test → fix cycle until all tasks are completed and verified.

No Assumptions or Hallucinations
Ask for clarification when unsure. Do not invent logic or data.

Fallbacks Require Approval
Do not add fallback logic or defaults without explicit authorization.

Clean Up Artifacts
Remove all temporary or development-only files and data after completion.

Follow Code Standards
Enforce consistent formatting and linting throughout the codebase.

Document Clearly
Provide concise inline comments, function docstrings, and README updates as needed.

Use Version Control Properly
Commit frequently with clear messages and use branches for features or fixes.
