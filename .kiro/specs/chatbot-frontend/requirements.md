# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive frontend interface for the AI-powered chatbot that assists users with pitch deck creation and refinement. The backend chatbot API is already fully implemented with two main endpoints: general chat assistance and speaker notes improvement. The frontend will provide an intuitive, accessible interface that integrates seamlessly with the existing deck editor workflow, while also optimizing current UI patterns to create a more cohesive and efficient user experience.
