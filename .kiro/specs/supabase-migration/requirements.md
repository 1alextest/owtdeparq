# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the AI Pitch Deck Generator backend from a local PostgreSQL database to Supabase, a managed PostgreSQL service. The migration will maintain all existing functionality while leveraging Supabase's additional features like real-time capabilities, built-in authentication, and simplified deployment. The migration must ensure zero data loss and minimal downtime while updating the backend-nestjs application to work seamlessly with Supabase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from local PostgreSQL to Supabase, so that I can leverage managed database services and reduce infrastructure complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL connect to Supabase instead of local PostgreSQL
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL successfully authenticate with Supabase using proper credentials
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL execute against the Supabase database with the same performance characteristics
4. IF the Supabase connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fail gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all existing data to be preserved during migration, so that no user data or application state is lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration process runs THEN it SHALL transfer all existing tables and data to Supabase
2. WHEN data migration completes THEN all foreign key relationships SHALL be maintained correctly
3. WHEN comparing pre and post migration data THEN the system SHALL have identical record counts and data integrity
4. IF data migration encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and allow for retry mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TypeORM configuration updated for Supabase, so that the ORM continues to work seamlessly with the new database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeORM initializes THEN it SHALL connect to Supabase using the correct connection parameters
2. WHEN running existing migrations THEN they SHALL execute successfully against Supabase
3. WHEN creating new migrations THEN they SHALL be compatible with Supabase's PostgreSQL implementation
4. IF TypeORM operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages specific to Supabase connectivity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment configuration updated for Supabase, so that different environments (dev, staging, prod) can use appropriate Supabase instances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN they SHALL include Supabase connection strings and API keys
2. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL connect to the correct Supabase project
3. WHEN credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error messages
4. IF environment configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance on required variables

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove PostgreSQL dependencies and Docker configurations, so that the local development setup is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker Compose is removed THEN local development SHALL no longer require Docker for database setup
2. WHEN PostgreSQL-specific configurations are removed THEN the codebase SHALL be cleaner and more maintainable
3. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL reflect the new Supabase-based setup process
4. IF legacy PostgreSQL references remain THEN they SHALL be identified and removed during cleanup

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing of the migration, so that I can be confident the system works correctly with Supabase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the existing test suite THEN all tests SHALL pass against the Supabase database
2. WHEN performing CRUD operations THEN they SHALL work identically to the previous PostgreSQL setup
3. WHEN testing complex queries and joins THEN they SHALL return the same results as before migration
4. IF any functionality breaks THEN the tests SHALL clearly identify the failing operations
