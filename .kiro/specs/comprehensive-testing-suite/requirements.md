# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive testing suite for the AI Pitch Deck Generator application. The testing suite will include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the application is fully functional, reliable, and deployment-ready.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend Unit Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for all backend services, controllers, and utilities, so that I can ensure individual components work correctly in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing service classes THEN all public methods SHALL have unit tests with 90%+ coverage
2. WHEN testing controller endpoints THEN all HTTP methods SHALL be tested with valid and invalid inputs
3. WHEN testing entity validation THEN all validation rules SHALL be verified with edge cases
4. WHEN testing utility functions THEN all branches and error conditions SHALL be covered
5. WHEN running unit tests THEN they SHALL execute in under 30 seconds
6. WHEN tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the failure reason

### Requirement 2: Backend Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests for database operations and external API calls, so that I can ensure components work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing database operations THEN all CRUD operations SHALL be tested with real database connections
2. WHEN testing AI provider integrations THEN all providers (OpenAI, Groq, Ollama) SHALL be tested with mock responses
3. WHEN testing authentication flows THEN Firebase integration SHALL be verified with test tokens
4. WHEN testing file operations THEN upload and storage functionality SHALL be validated
5. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN full request-response cycles SHALL be verified
6. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL use test database and clean up after execution

### Requirement 3: Frontend Unit Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unit tests for all React components and custom hooks, so that I can ensure UI components render and behave correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing React components THEN all props and state changes SHALL be verified
2. WHEN testing custom hooks THEN all hook logic and side effects SHALL be covered
3. WHEN testing utility functions THEN all frontend utilities SHALL have comprehensive tests
4. WHEN testing form validation THEN all validation rules SHALL be verified
5. WHEN testing event handlers THEN all user interactions SHALL be simulated and tested
6. WHEN running frontend tests THEN they SHALL execute in under 45 seconds

### Requirement 4: Frontend Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests for API calls and component interactions, so that I can ensure the frontend communicates correctly with the backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing API client THEN all HTTP requests SHALL be mocked and verified
2. WHEN testing authentication flow THEN login/logout processes SHALL be fully tested
3. WHEN testing data fetching THEN loading states and error handling SHALL be verified
4. WHEN testing form submissions THEN complete form workflows SHALL be tested
5. WHEN testing navigation THEN routing and page transitions SHALL be verified
6. WHEN testing real-time features THEN WebSocket connections SHALL be mocked and tested

### Requirement 5: End-to-End Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want end-to-end tests for critical user journeys, so that I can ensure the complete application workflow functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing user registration THEN complete signup flow SHALL be automated and verified
2. WHEN testing project creation THEN full project lifecycle SHALL be tested
3. WHEN testing deck generation THEN AI-powered deck creation SHALL be end-to-end tested
4. WHEN testing deck editing THEN slide manipulation and saving SHALL be verified
5. WHEN testing export functionality THEN PDF and PowerPoint generation SHALL be tested
6. WHEN running E2E tests THEN they SHALL use test environment and clean up test data

### Requirement 6: Performance Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tests to ensure the application meets speed and scalability requirements, so that users have a smooth experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing API response times THEN all endpoints SHALL respond within 2 seconds
2. WHEN testing database queries THEN complex queries SHALL execute within 500ms
3. WHEN testing AI generation THEN deck creation SHALL complete within 30 seconds
4. WHEN testing concurrent users THEN system SHALL handle 50 simultaneous users
5. WHEN testing memory usage THEN application SHALL not exceed 512MB RAM usage
6. WHEN testing load scenarios THEN system SHALL maintain 99% uptime under normal load

### Requirement 7: Test Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust test infrastructure and CI/CD integration, so that tests run automatically and provide reliable feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up test environment THEN test database SHALL be automatically configured
2. WHEN running tests in CI THEN all test suites SHALL execute in parallel
3. WHEN tests complete THEN coverage reports SHALL be generated and stored
4. WHEN tests fail THEN detailed logs and screenshots SHALL be captured
5. WHEN deploying THEN all tests SHALL pass before deployment proceeds
6. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL be isolated and not affect each other

### Requirement 8: Test Data Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent test data and fixtures, so that tests are reliable and repeatable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating test data THEN fixtures SHALL be version controlled and consistent
2. WHEN running tests THEN test data SHALL be automatically seeded before each test
3. WHEN tests complete THEN test data SHALL be cleaned up automatically
4. WHEN testing edge cases THEN boundary value test data SHALL be available
5. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN invalid test data SHALL be provided
6. WHEN updating schemas THEN test fixtures SHALL be automatically updated
