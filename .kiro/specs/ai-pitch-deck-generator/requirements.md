# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Pitch Deck Generator is a comprehensive web application that enables founders and early-stage entrepreneurs to create professional, investor-ready pitch decks using artificial intelligence. The system addresses the common challenge of creating structured, persuasive presentations by offering two generation modes: Free Mode for quick prompt-based generation and Custom Mode for guided, form-driven creation. The application supports multi-project management, real-time editing, multiple export formats, and intelligent AI learning capabilities.

**Key MVP Features:**
- Multi-AI provider support (OpenAI + Local Llama 3.1 8B)
- User-provided API key management
- Intelligent context memory and learning system
- Per-slide model selection with smart fallback
- Configurable AI learning scope (deck/project/global)
- AI-assisted chatbot for script writing and content refinement
- AI-suggested images and media integration
- Drag-and-drop slide reordering interface
- Slide templates library with pre-designed layouts
- Version control system for tracking changes

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js with NestJS framework
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication
- AI Integration: OpenAI API via Node.js SDK
