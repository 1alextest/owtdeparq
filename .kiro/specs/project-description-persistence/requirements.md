# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue where project descriptions are not being properly saved and retrieved in the AI Pitch Deck Generator application. Users are experiencing data loss when project descriptions that should be persisted are not coming back after being saved.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my project description to be automatically saved when I enter it, so that I don't lose my work if I navigate away or refresh the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a project description THEN the system SHALL automatically save it to the database
2. WHEN a user types in the project description field THEN the system SHALL debounce the save operation to avoid excessive database calls
3. WHEN a project description is successfully saved THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to the user
4. IF the save operation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and retry the operation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my project description to be retrieved and displayed when I return to a project, so that I can continue working where I left off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens an existing project THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display the saved project description
2. WHEN the project description is being loaded THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
3. IF the project description fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide a retry option
4. WHEN no project description exists THEN the system SHALL display an empty field with placeholder text

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my project description to be validated before saving, so that I can ensure the data is properly formatted and within acceptable limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a project description THEN the system SHALL validate the input length and format
2. IF the description exceeds maximum length THEN the system SHALL display a character count warning
3. WHEN the description contains invalid characters THEN the system SHALL sanitize the input
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent saving and show appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my project description changes to be tracked, so that I can see when it was last modified and potentially recover previous versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project description is saved THEN the system SHALL update the last modified timestamp
2. WHEN a user views a project THEN the system SHALL display when the description was last updated
3. WHEN a description is modified THEN the system SHALL log the change for audit purposes
4. IF a user wants to see change history THEN the system SHALL provide access to modification logs
