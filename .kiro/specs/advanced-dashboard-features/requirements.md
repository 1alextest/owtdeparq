# Advanced Dashboard Features - Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the implementation of advanced dashboard features to enhance user experience and productivity in the AI Pitch Deck Generator. These features focus on improving project organization, discoverability, performance, and providing users with professional templates to accelerate their workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Drag-and-Drop Project Organization

**User Story:** As a user with multiple projects, I want to organize my projects through drag-and-drop functionality so that I can prioritize and categorize them according to my workflow needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over a project card THEN the system SHALL display a drag handle indicator
2. WHEN I drag a project card THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing the drag state
3. WHEN I drag a project over another project THEN the system SHALL show drop zones and reordering preview
4. WHEN I drop a project in a new position THEN the system SHALL update the project order persistently
5. WHEN I drag a project THEN other projects SHALL smoothly animate to show the new layout
6. WHEN dragging is in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent other interactions with project cards
7. WHEN I release a drag outside valid drop zones THEN the project SHALL return to its original position
8. IF the drag operation fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message and revert the change

### Requirement 2: Advanced Search and Filtering

**User Story:** As a user with many projects, I want to quickly find specific projects using search and filters so that I can efficiently locate and work on the right content.

6. WHEN no projects match the filters THEN the system SHALL display a helpful "no results" state
7. WHEN I clear filters THEN the system SHALL restore the full project list
8. WHEN I search THEN the system SHALL highlight matching text in project cards
9. IF I have no projects matching search criteria THEN the system SHALL suggest creating a new project

### Requirement 3: Template Library Integration

**User Story:** As a user starting a new project, I want to choose from professional templates so that I can quickly create industry-specific pitch decks with appropriate structure and content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. WHEN I use a template THEN the system SHALL allow customization of all template content
6. WHEN templates are loading THEN the system SHALL show loading states with skeleton screens
7. WHEN I search templates THEN the system SHALL filter by name, industry, and tags
8. IF template loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options and error handling
9. WHEN I create from template THEN the system SHALL track template usage for analytics

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimizations with Lazy Loading

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I load the dashboard THEN the system SHALL load the first 12 projects immediately
2. WHEN I scroll near the bottom THEN the system SHALL automatically load more projects
3. WHEN additional projects are loading THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
4. WHEN I have many projects THEN the system SHALL virtualize the project list for performance
5. WHEN project images are loading THEN the system SHALL show placeholder images
6. WHEN I navigate away and back THEN the system SHALL preserve scroll position and loaded state
7. WHEN network is slow THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical content loading
8. IF loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms and error states
9. WHEN I filter or search THEN the system SHALL reset pagination and load relevant results

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Project Management

**User Story:** As a user managing multiple projects, I want advanced project management features so that I can better organize, track, and maintain my pitch deck portfolio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I right-click a project THEN the system SHALL show a context menu with advanced actions

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate hover states
2. WHEN I perform actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN content is loading THEN the system SHALL show skeleton screens instead of blank areas
4. WHEN I use keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard accessibility
5. WHEN animations play THEN the system SHALL respect user's motion preferences
